Habitat for Humanity Monterey Bay — Fundraising and Donor Strategy

This project was developed in collaboration with Habitat for Humanity Monterey Bay through 180 Degrees Consulting at UC Santa Cruz, with the objective of increasing the organization’s fundraising performance and donor engagement following the COVID-19 pandemic.

Overview

Our consulting team conducted a comprehensive analysis of donor acquisition, donor retention, fundraising strategy, and social media optimization. The goal was to identify practical strategies to expand Habitat’s revenue streams and strengthen donor relationships. The project emphasized cross-functional collaboration across marketing, communications, and operations teams to ensure that recommendations were data-backed, actionable, and aligned with organizational goals.

Focus Areas

Donor Acquisition: Designed and assessed email marketing frameworks using personalization, segmentation, and KPI tracking (open, click-through, and conversion rates).

Donor Retention: Developed strategies to improve first-time donor retention through personalized outreach, impact letters, and follow-up calls informed by research from DonorsChoose.org and Bloomerang.

Fundraising Strategy: Recommended peer-to-peer fundraising models and corporate gift-matching programs to diversify revenue streams and drive long-term engagement.

Social Media Optimization: Proposed a structured posting schedule, content rebranding aligned with Habitat’s global guidelines, and platform-specific strategies to enhance reach and engagement.

Methods and Tools

Conducted KPI benchmarking against nonprofit industry standards.

Synthesized findings from case studies across major nonprofit institutions (UCSD, Royal Children’s Hospital, DonorsChoose.org).

Collaborated with Habitat for Humanity’s internal teams to align analytical insights with operational priorities.

Utilized tools including Excel, Google Analytics, NetSuite, and Canva to support data analysis and content evaluation.

Outcomes

Identified a 20 percent potential increase in donations through improved donor segmentation and email personalization.

Proposed measures to raise donor retention rates by 8 to 10 percent through improved follow-up timing and targeted messaging.

Created a social media optimization plan to strengthen brand consistency and increase digital engagement across platforms.

Collaboration

This engagement required active collaboration between data analysts, marketing specialists, and nonprofit leadership to integrate quantitative insights with strategic implementation. The project exemplified how data-driven decision-making and cross-functional coordination can directly enhance fundraising effectiveness and community impact.
